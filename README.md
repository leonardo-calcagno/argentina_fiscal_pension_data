# Download Argentina open macro, fiscal and pension data

The goal of this repository is to store relevant code for getting Argentina macroeconomic, fiscal and social security data from open sources. This is a by-product of our social security projections made with the Microsimulation model for Social Security in Argentina (MISSAR), that needs this updated data.  

Although some data sets are already periodically updated by the alphacast (@aplhacastio) project on Python (most notably INDEC data), it is to the best of our knowledge the first automatic download and formatting of fiscal data such as the monthly Savings-Investment-Funding account (Cuenta Ahorro-Inversi√≥n-Financiamiento).
